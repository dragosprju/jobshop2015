# JobShop 2015

JobShop is a career fair event happening in Iași, Romania, held yearly by the student group BEST Iași. This is the 2015 variant, implemented by me at the time.

This is a static website manually made with pure HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. There's also some JavaScript and some PHP. At the time, I was better at developing in HTML/CSS than at using Wordpress (I know, right?) and the student group needed a face-lift for their website presence, so I was chosen to start building from scratch the website of the most important event of the group (being JobShop).

I like nice websites (Awwwards anyone?) and I've learned HTML/CSS at a young age, and so this was an opportunity where I was able to use my skills to develop something proper in the name of volunteering. Hence, it deserves a place in my repository.
